# CongressGAT: Graph Attention Networks for Predicting Legislative Defection

This repository contains code and data for **"The Geometry of Partisanship: Graph Attention Networks for Predicting Legislative Defection in the U.S. House, 1995-2024."**

## Overview

We construct temporal voting networks for every session of the U.S. House from the 104th through 118th Congress (1995-2024) and apply Graph Attention Networks (GATs) to predict which members will defect from their party line.

**Key results:**
- GAT achieves F1=0.75 and AUC=0.88 at 5% defection threshold, outperforming logistic regression (F1=0.60), random forests (F1=0.63), and naive baselines (F1=0.59)
- Fiedler vector of voting networks correlates with DW-NOMINATE at r>0.97
- Attention mechanism reveals same-party connections receive 200x more weight than cross-party ties
- Tea Party wave of 2010 produced a permanent 40% decline in cross-party agreement

## Data

Roll-call data from [Voteview](https://voteview.com/) (Lewis et al., 2023). Member CSVs are included; vote CSVs are excluded due to size (~500MB total). Download them from:
- `https://voteview.com/static/data/out/votes/H{num}_votes.csv`
- `https://voteview.com/static/data/out/members/H{num}_members.csv`

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- PyTorch 2.x
- PyTorch Geometric 2.x
- pandas, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, matplotlib

## Usage

```bash
python pipeline_full.py           - Process all congresses
python model_gat.py               - Train GAT and baselines
python generate_final_figures.py  - Generate figures
```

## Reproducibility Note: Fiedler Value Computation

The repository contains multiple pipeline scripts that compute spectral properties differently. The paper's reported Fiedler values use the method in `pipeline_fast.py`:

1. **Binary thresholding**: pairwise agreement scores are thresholded at τ = 0.5 to create an unweighted adjacency matrix (Section 3.2 of the paper).
2. **Isolated node removal**: nodes with zero degree after thresholding are removed before computing the Laplacian.
3. **Normalized Laplacian**: the Fiedler value is the second-smallest eigenvalue of L = I − D^{−1/2} A D^{−1/2}.

The older `pipeline_full.py` uses weighted agreement rates as the adjacency matrix without thresholding, which produces different spectral properties (notably, alternating near-zero values for Congresses where the weighted graph is nearly disconnected). The `spectral_results.json` file in the repo root was generated by `pipeline_full.py` and **does not match** the paper's reported values.

To reproduce the paper's spectral analysis, use `pipeline_fast.py` or the figure generation script `generate_all_figures.py`, both of which apply the binary threshold described in the paper.
